class BaseSteps(object):
    """Base steps-class.

    Steps-class aggregates steps over one resource. It means there are many
    inherited steps-classes for each resource.

    Note:
        Technically there are three types of steps:

        #. ``get``-steps

           Their goal to retrieve information about resource and return it. If
           information is unavailable, a step should raise exception. Rules to
           code:

           - step method name has prefix ``get_``, for ex: ``get_ips``,
             ``get_projects``, ``get_flavor``, ``get_network``.

           - step should return something in last code line, for ex:
             ``return projects``, ``return network``. It makes easier code
             review and debugging.

           - step can include argument ``check=True``. It's depends on context,
             for ex: step returns collection, but collection can be empty. And
             here ``check=True`` will help to check that collection has items.

        #. ``check``-steps

           Their goal to validate input resource and raise exception if it's
           invalid. Rules to code:

           - step method name has prefix ``check_``, for ex:
             ``check_image_presence``, ``check_project_bind_status``.

           - step should return nothing.

           - step should use code to raise exception: ``assert_that`` from
             hamcrest, ``wait``-methods which raise ``TimeoutExpired``,
             ``raise`` for explicit exception, another ``check_``-steps.

             .. warning::
                We don't use python ``assert``, prefer ``hamcrest`` library.

           - step should include argument ``timeout=0`` to provide check during
             the time.

        #. ``change``-steps

           Their goal to change resource and check that changing is successful.
           Rules to code:

           - step method name starts with a verb denoting the action.

           - step has argument ``check=True``.

           - step makes action over resource before check.

           - inside ``if check:`` step should use code to raise exception:
             ``assert_that`` from hamcrest, ``wait``-methods which raise
             ``TimeoutExpired``, ``raise`` for explicit exception, or
             ``check_``-step.

           - inside ``if check:`` step should return nothing. Its section is
             for verification only.

           - if step should return something (for ex: ``return image``), it
             should be after ``if check:``.

           - if after resource changing need to update object with resource
             info, for ex: ``server.get()``, it must be inside ``if check:``
             block (*see explanation below*)

             .. warning::
                Explanation when in step it should to update object with
                resource information, for ex: when it should to call
                ``server.get()``.

                .. hint::
                   Keep in mind, that objects like ``server``, ``image``,
                   ``volume``, ``flavor``, etc are not real resources.
                   They are just objects with information about the state of
                   resource at some point in time. And these info-objects
                   should be updated from time to time.

                First of all its updating should NEVER call BEFORE resource
                changing. "Fresh" info-object must be passed to step.

                Updating of info-object must be executed inside the same
                step, where resource is changed. But there two variants for ex:

                .. code:: python

                   # invalid variant
                   def attach_floating_ip(self, server, floating_ip,
                                          check=True):
                       self._client.add_floating_ip(server, floating_ip)
                       server.get()
                       if check:
                           floating_ips = self.get_ips(server,
                                                       'floating').keys()
                           assert floating_ip.ip in floating_ips

                .. code:: python

                   # valid variant
                   def attach_floating_ip(self, server, floating_ip,
                                          check=True):
                       self._client.add_floating_ip(server, floating_ip)
                       if check:
                           server.get()
                           floating_ips = self.get_ips(server,
                                                       'floating').keys()
                           assert floating_ip.ip in floating_ips

                Let's understand why second variant is better that first.
                ``Change``-step consist of two stages:
                - change resource state
                - retrieve resource state for checking.

                And ``server.get()`` is resource state retrieving and must be a
                part of checking. This is more clearly for async steps. Let's
                see how previous invalid variant would look as async:

                .. code:: python

                   # invalid async variant
                   def attach_floating_ip_async(self, server, floating_ip,
                                                check=True):
                       self._client.add_floating_ip(server, floating_ip)
                       server.get()
                       if check:
                           self.check_status(server, 'active')
                           floating_ips = self.get_ips(server,
                                                       'floating').keys()
                           assert floating_ip.ip in floating_ips

                Here ``server.get()`` doesn't reflect actual state or resource,
                because resource is changed async. That why ``check_status``
                is used to wait some stable resource state, and it uses
                ``server.get()`` inside itself. So we see double usage of
                ``server.get()`` and first its call absolutely useless.

                And in case, when step will be called with ``check=False``,
                call ``server.get()`` doesn't get actual resource state,
                because resource is changed async.

                It means that ``server.get()`` is useful for checking only, but
                otherwise it's useless.

        Common rules:

        - each step method has docstring, explaining its mission.

    See Also:
        **Why do we make steps with optional verification** ``check=True``?

        Sometimes (may be very rarely) we will need to make step without
        verification. In negative tests, for ex: try to create server
        without name and check that there is error.
        But more often we need positive verification by default to guarantee
        that step of a test was finished successfully and the test can go to
        another step.
