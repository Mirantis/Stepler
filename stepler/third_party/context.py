def context(func):
    """Decorator to make context manager from generator with guaranteed
    finalization.

    Note:
        ``contextlib.contextmanager`` doesn't guarantee context manager
        finalization and requires usage of ``try-finally`` for that. But in
        fixtures it needs to rid of ``try-finally`` and to guarantee context
        manager finalization after ``yield``. This decorator makes that.

    Example:
        .. code:: python

           @pytest.fixture
           def create_server_context(server_steps):

               @context
               def _create_server_context(server_name, *args, **kwgs):
                   server = server_steps.create_server(server_name,
                                                       *args, **kwgs)
                   yield server
                   server_steps.delete_server(server)

               return _create_server_context

        #. Exception inside context manager:

           .. code:: python

              @context
              def x():
                  yield

              with x():
                  raise Exception('error')

           ``Exception: error`` will be raised.

        #. Exception in context manager finalization:

           .. code:: python

              @context
              def x():
                  yield
                  raise Exception('final')

              with x():
                  pass

           ``Exception: final`` will be raised.

        #. Exceptions inside context manager and in finalization:

           .. code:: python

              @context
              def x():
                  yield

              with x():
                  raise Exception('error')

           ``Exception: error`` will be raise as root cause.
