    """**Scenario:** Ban l3-agent with ACTIVE ha_state for router.

    **Setup:**

    #. Create cirros image
    #. Create flavor
    #. Create security group
    #. Create network_1 with subnet_1 and router
    #. Create server_1
    #. Create floating ip
    #. Create network_2 with subnet_2
    #. Add network_2 interface to router
    #. Create server_2 on another compute and connect it to network_2

    **Steps:**

    #. Attach floating IP to server_1
    #. Check ping from server_1 to server_2
    #. Restart ovs-agents with pcs enable/disable on controllers
    #. Check ping from server_1 to server_2

    **Teardown:**

    #. Delete servers
    #. Delete networks, subnets, router
    #. Delete floating IP
    #. Delete security group
    #. Delete cirros image
    #. Delete flavor
