    **Setup:**

    #. Create cirros image
    #. Create flavor
    #. Create security group
    #. Create network_1 with subnet_1 and DVR
    #. Create server_1
    #. Create floating ip
    #. Create network_2 with subnet_2
    #. Add network_2 interface to router
    #. Create server_2 on another compute and connect it to network_2

    **Steps:**

    #. Assign floating ip to server_1
    #. Check that ping from server_1 to server_2 is successful

    **Teardown:**

    #. Delete servers
    #. Delete cirros image
    #. Delete security group
    #. Delete flavor
    #. Delete router
    #. Delete subnets
